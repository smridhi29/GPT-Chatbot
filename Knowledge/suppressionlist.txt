What is a suppression list?
A suppression list contains all the email addresses who have opted out/unsubscribed from your emails or have marked your emails as spam. You make this list to ensure that you do not send emails to such email addresses as doing so might damage your reputation. A suppression list helps maintain the sender’s reputation by ensuring that they send emails to those who want to receive them.
