```

## Usage

You will need to set up an OpenAI API key to use the chatbot. You can sign up for an API key at the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/).
The data to be fed into the chatbot should be stored in txt format in the 'Knowledge' folder, present in the root directory of the project

Once the chatbot is running, type in a question and the chatbot will try to find the best answer from the data fed into it.
